# I dare you!
I am interested in Internet Privacy and I think that I have done a pretty good job in protecting **my own digital identity**.

This is why I dare you:

**Find out everything you can about me!**

Specifically:
- Send me an email to my personal address 
(\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*@p\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*.com)
which includes the following information:
    - real name
    - full birth date
    - home address
    - work address
    - occupation
    
Feel free to add any additional infos you might find. The more the better!

Looking forward to your emails. Have fun!
